I'm not sure which tests you want to do, but here is a quick rundown:
1) You can create a gym or a workout. This should not be a hard test, but you have to make sure that all of the pieces that are listed as "required" in the database
    need to be included. If you go to the Seed file, it has a template on how to create all of the different types. I imagine that that would be the easiest to test.
2) I would just create a new file for tests within the project. Pretty much every other folder runs on naming conventions (i.e. the GymController, the Gym model, and the Gym views only recognize each other by the name (I didn't have to tell them which were which). It might get confused. 
3) This is Dotnet ASP.Net 6.0, it is VERY important that you only follow any tutorials fit for this version. (I had to learn this the incredibly hard way)
